<h1>Petrol Simulator</h1>
This repository contains code for a VB.Net application, written for an assessment at Priestley College, which simulates a petrol / gas pump at a petrol / gas station. 
To run this project on your device, download and install <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio</a>. The community edition is free to use. When the installer opens, select the .Net desktop development workload. 
Next, download the simulator code, open the SLN (solution) file. When the IDE appears, press F5 or the green start button to compile and launch the app.

<h2>Features</h2>
You can adjust the price per litre. When you start dispensing the fuel, a new transaction begins (which includes the amount dispensed and the amount to pay). 
The transaction can be stopped or restarted at any time and can be added to the grand total; when added, a new sale begins. Note that the petrol / gas pump has limited capacity (max 100 litres).
The project was revisited in 2021 to add an app icon, prevent the app from appearing blury for users with high DPI settings and to make all colours use those defined by Windows (so that it can fully adapt to high contrast themes).
